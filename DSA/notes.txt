big O the language for algorithm description....

wanna send a friend overseas a file? how would u send it? 
email? maybe... fly it over? maybe .... seee it depends and thats why we have different algorithm and data structures for different use cases...

so always necessary to understand your algorithm and how efficient it is....

via emai?O(n) where n is the size of the file... time its takes(in terms of number of operations) depend on size...

fly it over? maybe O(1)... SIZE DONT REALLY MATTER..... time is contsant...
