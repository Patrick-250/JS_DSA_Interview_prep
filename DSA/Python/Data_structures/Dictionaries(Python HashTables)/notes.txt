"""
dictionaries prety much helps us control internal indices and call them our own names... in array indices
always are 0 to n-1


in dictionaries we can call indices whatever pleases us... this helps in the future when we wanna access that index..
all we have to do is do dictionary[index] #index here is the key; see below

the tradeoff here is that we loose the order that is internally found in arrays(Lists)
"""

#dictionaries are created with curly brackets and reperesent the key value pair of informations... where keys are kinda like indices
#keys need to be strings,numbers or tuples and also each key has to be unique.

"""
dictionaries are implemented with hash function inrternally.. like the hash function will take in the key and then
turns it into a pre defined mathematical number (maybe lol) that represent index to the memory address where the value is stored.
# as u propably guessed, a hash function used needs to be as fast as possible
#the hash function also gives the same output given the same input...(this is why keys needs to be unique)
#finaly a good hash function needs to distribute keys uniformly...

"""
              ******limitations of dictionaries(hash tables)******

'''
sometimes, the hash function might hash 2 distinct keys to the same value; this is called collision.
2 methods to solve this are separate chaining and open addressing. to be continued.....
