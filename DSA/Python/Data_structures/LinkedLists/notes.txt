"""
-as lists themselves require more memory allocation(dynamic arrays)
-we need to know the size of the array before hand(static array)
-adding and removing items from the beginning or inside of the array is expensive; O(n)

#LinkedLists are here to fix the above limitations by changing how elements are stored in memory...

instead of [6,2,5,6] array; the LinkedList is stored as 6->2->5->6
#each elemet can only have one link to another element and not more.

"""


'''
to create a LinkedList, we have to create a container with 2 pieces of informations:
-one for the info we need to store(value)
-another for the link(pointer)
#the last element points to nothing; None(null in stubborn javascript lol)

#each block of those containers is called a node

#the first Node is called head and the last node is called tail

#looking at the LinkedList, its like each node is connected to the other in linaer fashion; whoever under the hood, each item in a LinkedList
IS WRAPPED in its own container(node) while items in array are all WRAPPED in the same container(the array itself)
#in LinkedList we cannot access each item by index
