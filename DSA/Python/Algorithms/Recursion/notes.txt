                           *****Recursion Intro********

Recursion isnt really an algorithm but rather just a (.......not really sure what to call it lol)...

# in recursion we solve a bigger problem by using solutions for the smaller problem(smaller version of bigger prob)...

#classic factorial problem is the start to understand this...

# n!=n*(n-1)!... the factorial of a number is the product of that number and the factorial of the previous number...

'''
so instead of trying to solve the factorial of let's say 4, we can easy our problem to finding the factorial of 3 and then multiply that to 4; 
hmmm, now we can redo this principle again, to find the factorial of 3, we can find the factorial of 2 and then multiply that with 3; 
again, to find the factorial of 2, we can find the factorial of 1 then multiply that with 2. 
again to find the factorial of 1, we can find the factorial of zero(which is 1 by conversion; 0!=1) and then multiply that with 1.

as you probably guessed, we always need to have some return results that is already known (0! in the above exaample);
 this is what is called the base case and that is where our recursion stops.

 another part of recursion after base case is the inner call called recursive case... recursive case needs to be 
 defined so as it has a way to eventually reach the base case... otherwise we would have infite calls that never reaches base case.
 
 check start.py code

what if we dont have the base case(classic guarnted to cause stack overflow) this means that the program will run forever.... which might crush the system.
systems manufacturers already know this and they handled this... the function will get called until it reaches the maximum recursion depth or atleast
exhaust the available memory(which the error is called stack overflow; as the functions calls actually get added in a stack)...
in start.py, try using it to find the factorial of 998; does it work? okay maybe yes, now try 999, what happened? I got the 
RecursiveError... you guessed it we cannot use recursion to get the factorial of a number more than 998....(trust me that factorial is very very very
large i would bet no human can even read that number lols).
